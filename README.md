# solidity-resources

Hi. My name is Andreas Olofsson and I work for [Eris Industries](http://erisindustries.com). I work with smart contracts a lot. These are some resources that might be useful for someone who wants to get into smart contract writing.

### Written tutorials

Written tutorials will be put in the `published` directory. There's a folder for each series (only one thus far), and each part of the series has its own folder. Inside each of these part folders is the tutorial (as a markdown file) along with an `img` folder that keeps diagrams and such, and a `resources`folder that holds example Solidity contracts and javascript/html. There may be other things in there as well.

### Video

My youtube channel contains a Solidity tutorial which is being updated continously:

### Old resources

I have an old LLL video tutorial in my old channel:

There's also an old LLL contract repository here: 

https://github.com/androlo/EthereumContracts

Those contracts are the backbone of an old system, and is not very useful. They should certainly not be used as code examples. The code in [this](https://github.com/androlo/LLL-commons) repo is a bit cleaner. 

**WARNING: The quality of the old code (and videos) should generally be considered low. It was basically just proof-of-concept code.**
